    title = "A Survey on Deep Learning Techniques for Stereo-based Depth Estimation",
    abstract = "Estimating depth from RGB images is a long-standing ill-posed problem, which has been explored for decades by the computer vision, graphics, and machine learning communities. Among the existing techniques, stereo matching remains one of the most widely used in the literature due to its strong connection to the human binocular system. Traditionally, stereo-based depth estimation has been addressed through matching hand-crafted features across multiple images. Despite the extensive amount of research, these traditional techniques still suffer in the presence of highly textured areas, large uniform regions, and occlusions. Motivated by their growing success in solving various 2D and 3D vision problems, deep learning for stereo-based depth estimation has attracted growing interest from the community, with more than 150 papers published in this area between 2014 and 2019. This new generation of methods has demonstrated a significant leap in performance, enabling applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of this new and continuously growing field of research, summarize the commonly used pipelines, and discuss their benefits and limitations. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we conjecture what the future may hold for deep learning-based stereo for depth estimation research.",

    abstract = {Abstract Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and stereo cameras are two generally used solutions for perceiving 3D information. The complementary properties of these two sensor modalities motivate a fusion to derive practicable depth sensing toward real-world applications. Promoted by deep neural network (DNN) techniques, recent works achieve superior performance on accuracy. However, the complex architecture and the sheer number of DNN parameters often lead to poor generalization capacity and non-real-time computing. In this paper, we present FastFusion, a three-stage stereo-LiDAR deep fusion scheme, which integrates the LiDAR priors into each step of classical stereo-matching taxonomy, gaining high-precision dense depth sensing in a real-time manner. We integrate stereo-LiDAR information by taking advantage of a compact binary neural network and utilize the proposed cross-based LiDAR trust aggregation to further fuse the sparse LiDAR measurements in the back-end of stereo matching. To align the photometrical of the input image and the depth of the estimation, we introduce a refinement network to guarantee consistency. More importantly, we present a graphic processing unit-based acceleration framework for providing a low-latency implementation of FastFusion, gaining both accuracy improvement and real-time responsiveness. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of FastFusion, which obtains a significant speedup over state-of-the-art baselines while achieving comparable accuracy on depth sensing. The video demo for real-time depth estimation of FastFusion on the real-world driving scenario is available at https://youtu.be/nP7cls2BA8s.},
